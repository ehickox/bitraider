# bitraider
A Library of tools for algorithmic Bitcoin trading in Python. Bitraider includes a Coinbase 
Exchange API wrapper, a CLI dashboard for backtesting or running a trader, and an abstract
strategy class that enables you to implement different trading techniques.

###Quickstart:

1. `pip install bitraider`

2. Create a new directory in which your trader will reside
```
mkdir example_trader
cd example_trader
```

3. Create an `auth.txt` with your CoinbaseExchange API key, secret, and passphrase on lines 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
```
vim auth.txt
```

In auth.txt:
```
MY-API-KEY-HERE
MY-API-SECRET-HERE
MY-API-PASSPHRASE-HERE
```

4. Create a class that inherits from bitraider.strategy. Implement all necessary functions.
```
from bitraider import strategy as strategy
    
    class my_strategy(strategy):
        def backtest_strategy(self, historical_data, start_btc, start_usd):
            for timeslice in historical_data:
                pass
```

5. run:
```
    bitraider
```

Package Organization
====================
The bitraider package contains the following subpackages
1. strategy: a module containing what a strategy class should look like
2. cbexchange: a module containing cb_exchange, a CoinbaseExchange API Wrapper
3. trader_template: a terminal-style dashboard for backtesting or running trading strategies.

TODO:
======
1. Implement logic for actual trades, not just backtesting
2. Implement flow for creating an auth.txt within the CLI
3. Sanitize inputs better
